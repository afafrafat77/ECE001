    <p class="a">Java continues to rock the top position in the charts of “Programming Languages”. Recently Java has completed its 22nd year since its advent in 1995 by James Gosling and the recent being Java11 on September 25, 2018.</p>
    <p class="a">The long run has been made possible by its features of platform-independence, scalability, security, etc. Java derives its features of object-orientation, variables, Data types of C/C++ and in fact, the syntax that is influenced by C++.</p>
    <p class="a">Java’s popularity is mainly due to its platform-independence feature which makes it run on different types of computer, either its Macintosh or Windows or Unix or Linux or even Mainframe/mobile phones as long as it has JVM installed in it.</p>
    <p class="a">Java code that has been written 15 years back can be made to run even on the latest JVM. One more notable feature is that it is fundamentally object-oriented and this makes Java be robust as Java objects contain no references to external data.</p>
