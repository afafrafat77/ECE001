    <p class="a">Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general programming purposes. It was released in 1991.</p>
    <p class="a">Python has been designed to give importance to code readability and significantly using whitespaces. Dynamic type, automatic memory management, supporting multiple programming paradigm(PO, Functional, procedural), a large comprehensive library of its own etc., are its notable features.</p>
    <p class="a">Python interpreters are available for many operating systems and it is an open source software. As of January 2018, it is the fourth most popular language (after Java, c, c++). A recent study analyzed that such scripting languages are more productive than conventional languages.</p>
    <p class="a">Python can be embedded in many software products, used in several Artificial Intelligence projects & in the Information security industry and can also serve as a scripting language for web applications.</p>
    <p class="a">Large organizations that use python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo etc. Libre office includes python and intends to replace Java with python. Go, Kotlin, Swift etc, have derived some of their features from python.</p>
