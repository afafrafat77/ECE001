    <p class="a">JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly typed, Prototype-based, high-level, interpreted programming language. Its take the position of one of the core technologies of the world wide web. It enables the creation of interactive webpages.</p>
    <p class="a">Initially, only client-side web browsers were implemented in JavaScript, but it is now embedded in various host software including server side in web servers and also in run-time environments that make it function on mobile, and desktop applications.</p>
    <p class="a">Even though it carries a similarity in its name with Java Language, it is distinct from Java by its dynamic functionality, human-readable code, etc.</p>
    <p class="a">The supporting technologies or languages that are related to JavaScript are JSON (Data Interchange Format), jQuery (Client-side HTML Scripting), Angular and Angular (Web Application Frameworks for developing SPA), React (JS Library), asm.js etc.</p>
    <p class="a">Standardization of web Assembly by W3C made programming Languages such as C, C++, Java as well as JS to author client-side code for the world wide web. However, JavaScript has now risen to biblical levels and experts say that its time to go down…and yes….partially correct too.</p>
    <p class="a">As the preferred language for client-side development varies along with the web assembly back ends, JavaScript is at times confusing to use owing to the availability of several web options.</p>
